                                A graphic designer is a professional within the graphic design and graphic arts industry
                                who assembles together images, typography, or motion graphics to create a piece of
                                design. A graphic designer creates the graphics primarily for published, printed, or
                                electronic media, such as brochures and advertising. They are also sometimes responsible
                                for typesetting, illustration, user interfaces, and web design. A core responsibility of
                                the designer's job is to present information in a way that is both accessible and
                                memorable.

                                <h2>ELIGIBILTY</h2>
                                Aspirants who have cleared their 10+2 from any stream (Science/ Commerce/ Arts) can
                                pursue a Graphic Design course at the graduation level. However, most popular colleges
                                allow candidates to take part in their admission process only if they have completed
                                their schooling from a recognised board.



                                <h2>SCOPE AND OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
                                In 2008, there were 2,86,100 people employed in graphic design jobs. By 2018, the U.S.
                                Bureau of Labour Statistics predicts that the number of graphic design jobs will
                                increase by 13%. The graphics designing industry is a very competitive industry when we
                                speak in terms of freelancing (which is 25% of all graphic designers); with people all
                                across the globe competing for projects.

                                Even when we speak in terms of companies; there is a lot of competition between the
                                firms to get the account. It is a very tough industry to compete in. Many inexperienced
                                designers work long hours on assignments which cause many new comers in the field to
                                become discouraged and leave the industry.
                                Freelancing jobs are found on many websites online such as Corflot and Krop. Graphic
                                design firms are located all over the world, mostly in large cities such as London, New
                                York and Mumbai.
