                                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                A purchasing manager is responsible for securing vendors, goods or services for
                                their company. They serve as a kind of salesperson for the company so they can
                                secure what they need that's a good combination of quality and price. They may speak
                                with vendors and suppliers, negotiate pricing and delivery responsibilities and
                                review the items they receive for quality.

                                <h2>Scope</h2>
                                Medium
                                <h2>Competition</h2>
                                Medium
                                <h2>Income</h2>
                                Average salary for a Purchase Manager in India is 6.6 Lakhs per year (₹55.0k per
                                month). Salary estimates are based on 9277 salaries received from various Purchase
                                Managers across industries.

                                <h2>Recommended Roadmap</h2>

                                <h3>1. Get a bachelor's degree</h3>
                                To begin working in the procurement industry, you can pursue a bachelor's degree.
                                Some of the commonly pursued disciplines include business administration, finance
                                and supply chain management. Popular degrees include BBA (Bachelor of Business
                                Administration), BBA in Finance and BBA in Supply Chain Management.

                                <h3>2. Earn a professional certification</h3>
                                You can improve your skills and stand ahead of the competition with a professional
                                certification. You can pursue online certification courses to get credentials like a
                                Certified Purchasing Professional or a Senior Professional in Supply Chain
                                Management certification. The Indian Institute of Materials Management and the
                                Institute for Supply Management also offer several courses in sourcing, material
                                management and logistics, that have value in the field of purchase management.

                                <h3>3. Work as a purchasing agent</h3>
                                To advance to a management position, you may require procurement industry
                                experience. Most purchasing managers have at least five years of experience working
                                as a buyer, purchasing agent or procurement officer. After you gain relevant
                                industry experience and advance your skills, you can apply for administrative
                                positions in your company or another one.

                                <h3>4. Master key skills and gain industry knowledge</h3>
                                Since purchasing managers are mid-career employees, they typically have several
                                years of work experience by the time they get to the position. Most work as buyers
                                or purchasing agents for at least five years before advancing to this management
                                role. As entry-level purchasing agents, these professionals usually complete up to a
                                year of on-the-job training. During this time, they become adept at various aspects
                                of supply chain management, including researching and negotiating with suppliers and
                                tracking inventory adjustments.

                                    other skills that are valuable in the workplace. They create curriculums and host
                                    classes where they teach in a way that is beneficial to employees and help them grow
                                    their skill and knowledge.

                                    Corporate Trainer salary in India ranges between ₹ 2.0 Lakhs to ₹ 15.0 Lakhs with an
                                    average annual salary of ₹ 5.3 Lakhs.

                                    <h2>Recommended Roadmap</h2>

                                    Professionals working in corporate training and development environments need a
                                    variety of skills ranging from instructional design to change management to
                                    organisational leadership. Excellent communication and presentation skills are a
                                    plus along with related soft skills and a knowledge of HR environments.

                                    <h3>1. Understand the role</h3>
                                    Corporate training is a potentially lucrative filed these days as every organisation
                                    craves competitive advantage with highly skilled and capable manpower. Not all
                                    organisations are equipped to train their own manpower for the present and future
                                    competencies and therefore require external help. Corporate trainers typically find
                                    themselves teaching topics that people don’t learn in their formal education, such
                                    as communication skills, business writing etiquette, public speaking, presentation
                                    skills and other job-specific functional and technical skills. You might know
                                    workplace trainers by other titles like Training and Development Professional,
                                    Learning Development Coordinator, Workplace Trainer or simply Training Consultant.
                                    Although these positions may have differences in their job description, they often
                                    have responsibilities of designing, implementing or assessing training programmes.

                                    <h3>2. Look in the mirror – are you the corporate trainer type?</h3>
                                    Perhaps you are considering a career in corporate training, or perhaps you’re
                                    already doing it but aren’t sure if you should continue. If you have these four
                                    qualities, then you’re definitely in the right profession.
                                    You enjoy standing in front of people and letting them judge you
                                    You are willing to be a little irreverent
                                    You enjoy learning more all the time
                                    You get a rush when you feel like someone ‘gets it’.

                                    <h3>3. Understand the challenges</h3>
                                    One may compare Corporate Trainers with teachers, but the two jobs are very
                                    different. Teachers have a certain position of authority because of which students
                                    have a natural tendency to follow their instructions, trainers enjoy no such luxury
                                    and have to build a strong relationship with their learners to get the message
                                    across. This is a significant challenge. Trainers need to possess a natural ease in
                                    dealing with people, an ability to present themselves with confidence, speak before
                                    a large audience with conviction, a mature thought process to create training
                                    material relevant to their audience, spontaneity to respond to difficult situations
                                    with ease, a good sense of humour, loads of enthusiasm and most importantly a
                                    passion for the subject matter that is being presented.

                                    <h3>4. Check if your education background is suitable</h3>
                                    While people who enter this career typically first earn a bachelor’s degree, there
                                    is no specific field that is necessary to specialise in. We also find that corporate
                                    trainers hold degrees in education. An education degree provides the knowledge and
                                    expertise needed to excel in this role. Other common educational backgrounds for
                                    this role include psychology, human resources, business, communication, and training
                                    and development.

                                    <h3>5. Strengthen your industry specific skills</h3>
                                    You should always be looking at how you can develop your skills in your chosen area
                                    of expertise. For example, you may need to take a course in particular software
                                    products so that you can incorporate them into your presentation or teach employees
                                    how to use them. Keep abreast of industry developments and constantly refresh your
                                    training approaches.
                                    As a trainer, you should keep taking training courses yourself. Not only will you
                                    enhance your skills and knowledge, but you will experience how other trainers work
                                    and could get useful ideas.

                                    <h3>6. Get certified</h3>
                                    A quick readthrough of corporate trainer job listings suggests that employers search
                                    for candidate who are certified professional trainers, and even specify some
                                    specialty certifications. You can increase your chances of career progression and
                                    the value of your training programmes by becoming certified with a professional
                                    body. This will effectively vouch for the quality of your work. Becoming a certified
                                    professional trainer, or getting one or more specialty certifications, can help you
                                    stand out from a crowd of similarly qualified applicants when you're looking for
                                    work.

                                    <h3>7. Apply for jobs as a corporate trainer</h3>
                                    Once you have the qualifications and the industry knowledge it's time to start
                                    applying for corporate trainer jobs. When you do this, be sure to pay close
                                    attention to the job descriptions to ensure that your qualifications and skills
                                    match the requirements of the job. You are unlikely to find your dream job at the
                                    outset so be prepared to be flexible and open-minded about the possibilities that
                                    are out there. If you only see listings for jobs that require experience, think
                                    about how you can gain relevant experience in a slightly different role, such as a
                                    training assistant, human resources worker, or public relations specialist. If you
                                    see a frequent requirement in the person specification that you don't have, think
                                    about how you can gain this skill.

                                    To summarise, the role of corporate trainer is ideal for someone who is outgoing,
                                    friendly, loves working with people and enjoys teaching. If you have an education
                                    degree and are considering your career options, you can definitely become a
                                    corporate trainer by following the above seven steps.
