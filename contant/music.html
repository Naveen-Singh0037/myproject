                                    Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody,
                                    harmony, rhythm,
                                    and timbre. It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies.
                                    It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General
                                    definitions of
                                    music include common elements such as pitch (which
                                    governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter,
                                    and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities
                                    of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).



                                    <h2><b>SKILLS REQUIRED</b> </h2>
                                    Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice.
                                    A person who sings is called a
                                    singer or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music).
                                    Singers perform music (arias, recitatives,
                                    songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments.



                                    <h2><b>SCOPE</b></h2>

                                    <p>A singing career is any type of job that involves singing in some capacity. While
                                        most people
                                        associate a singing career with famous singers and musicians, there are several
                                        other
                                        opportunities to work as a singer.</p>
                                    <p> There are also a number of different positions a singer can
                                        have, such as a wedding singer or singing teacher. Regardless of what type of
                                        position a
                                        person holds in the singing industry, they ultimately spend much of their
                                        professional time
                                        singing, teaching singing or assisting in the creation of music.
